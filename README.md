# Baselines incl. RUDDER

Uses RUDDER on PPO to solve environments with delayed rewards. Our RUDDER paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07857](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07857). 

**See https://widmi.github.io/ for a quick tutorial on reward redistribution with tensorflow implementation and code-snippets that you can run on your CPU.**

Our code is based on the [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) package, in which we included our implementation of RUDDER for PPO for ATARI games with delayed rewards.
Additionally, the [Tensorflow Layer Library (TeLL)](https://github.com/bioinf-jku/tensorflow-layer-library) package (v1.0.0) is required for RUDDER.

RUDDER for PPO2 and documentation for the configuration is located in the folder [baselines/ppo2_rudder](baselines/ppo2_rudder).
